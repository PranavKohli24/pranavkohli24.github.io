            <p>I've always been like this.</p>

            <p>Random thoughts pop up at random times.</p>

            <p>I'll be brushing my teeth and suddenly think, wait… how did life even begin on Earth?<br>
            Or I'll be lying on my bed and wonder how GitHub manages millions of repositories at that scale.</p>

            <p>It's just a small spark. Quiet. Curious. And once it shows up, I want to follow it.</p>

            <p>Before ChatGPT, most of those sparks died quickly. I'd Google something, open a few tabs, skim half-answers, lose interest, and move on. You know the drill.</p>

            <p>Then one night, I typed one of those thoughts into ChatGPT. No effort, no framing. Just:<br>
            <i>"So how did life even start? Explain it like I'm curious, not preparing for an exam."</i></p>

            <p>The response felt different.<br>
            Not like a lecture. More like someone talking it through with me. Clear. Calm. Almost story-like.</p>

            <p>That's when things shifted.</p>

            <p>Slowly, ChatGPT became the place I went for every "wait a second…" thought.</p>

            <p><b>Why did humans evolve the way they did?</b><br>
            <b>How did Einstein even arrive at time dilation?</b><br>
            <b>What was Earth like before anything familiar existed?</b></p>

            <p>The answers weren't just facts. They were journeys. How ideas formed. What came before. Why something mattered.</p>

            <p>It took my curiosity seriously without making it heavy.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we'd go deep into side paths. Evolution, space, ancient environments, technology. Other times, it stayed simple. Exactly what I needed in that moment.</p>

            <p>And that's what made it addictive in a good way.</p>

            <p>No pressure. No noise. Just the quiet satisfaction of following a question and seeing where it leads.</p>

            <p>It felt like having a really smart friend who's always up for talking about anything, big or small, without making it feel like homework.</p>

            <p>My curiosity wasn't something to control or optimize. It was something to enjoy.</p>

            <p>And the best part? Learning started to feel natural again.</p>

            <p>One thought led to another. Suddenly I'd learned something new without planning to. That feeling hits different when you're learning just because you want to.</p>

            <p>It's like having a personal rabbit-hole guide on standby. Whether the question is about consciousness, evolution, or why the sky looked weird that evening.</p>

            <p>My curiosity isn't loud. It's not dramatic.<br>
            It shows up quietly when things slow down.</p>

            <p>ChatGPT just gave me a way to follow those moments without friction. Turning small questions into small adventures. And some of those adventures stay with me long after.</p>

            <p>Honestly, that's all I ever wanted.</p>
